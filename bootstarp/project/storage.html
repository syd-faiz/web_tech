                <p class="lead">A motherboard is a printed circuit board that serves as the foundation for a computer
                    system. It provides the electrical connections and interfaces between all the components of a
                    computer, including the CPU (central processing unit), RAM (random access memory), storage devices,
                    expansion cards, and peripherals.<br>

                    The motherboard contains a variety of components, including a CPU socket, memory slots, expansion
                    slots (such as PCIe), SATA and M.2 connectors for storage devices, USB and audio connectors for
                    peripherals, and networking interfaces. Some motherboards also include onboard graphics or sound
                    cards.
                    <br><br>
                    When selecting a motherboard, it's important to consider the compatibility with the CPU, RAM, and
                    other components that you plan to use. The form factor of the motherboard also needs to be
                    considered to ensure it fits in the case you plan to use.
                    <br><br>
                    Motherboards also come with different features and capabilities, such as overclocking support,
                    built-in Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, and RGB lighting. The price of a motherboard can vary depending on its
                    features and capabilities.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, the motherboard plays a crucial role in a computer system and is responsible for ensuring
                    that all the components can communicate and function together properly.
                    <br><br>
                    Here is some additional information.<br>
                   1) Motherboards come in different form factors, which refer to their size and shape. Some common form
                    factors for desktops include ATX, Micro-ATX, and Mini-ITX.
<br><br>
                  2)  The CPU socket on a motherboard is designed to be compatible with a specific type or series of CPUs.
                    This means that if you want to upgrade your CPU, you may need to replace the motherboard as well.
<br><br>
                  3)  RAM slots on a motherboard are also designed to be compatible with specific types and speeds of RAM.
                    It's important to check the motherboard's specifications to ensure that it's compatible with the RAM
                    you plan to use.
<br><br>
                   4) The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is a firmware that's stored on a chip on the motherboard. It
                    provides the basic instructions for the computer to start up and initialize the hardware components.

                    Some motherboards include built-in hardware features, such as RAID controllers, to enable advanced
                    storage configurations.
<br><br>
                   5) Overclocking is the process of increasing the clock speed of a CPU or RAM beyond its factory-set
                    specifications. Some motherboards are designed to support overclocking, allowing users to boost
                    performance beyond what's possible with stock settings.
<br><br>
                    When building a computer, it's important to select a motherboard that's compatible with the case you
                    plan to use. The motherboard needs to fit within the case's dimensions and have the right mounting
                    points to secure it in place.
